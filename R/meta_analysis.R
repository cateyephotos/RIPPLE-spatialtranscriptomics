#' @description Fisher's combined p-value with a sign-consistency gate for
#'   combining per-sample results across biological replicates. This is the
#'   only cross-replicate combination step in RIPPLE; per-gene effect sizes
#'   are summarised as the median of per-sample log-rate coefficients.

#' Fisher's combined p-value with sign consistency gate - RECOMMENDED APPROACH
#'
#' Combines per-sample p-values using Fisher's method, with an additional
#' requirement that a minimum fraction of samples agree on the direction
#' of the effect. This prevents combining p-values when samples disagree
#' on whether a gene is induced or repressed.
#'
#' @param pvals Numeric vector of per-sample p-values.
#' @param coefs Numeric vector of per-sample coefficients (for sign checking).
#' @param min_samples Integer. Minimum number of valid samples required
#'   (default: 2).
#' @param sign_threshold Numeric. Required fraction of samples agreeing on
#'   effect direction (default: 1.0, i.e., all samples must agree).
#' @param min_sig_fraction Numeric. Optional per-sample significance gate
#'   (default: 0, disabled). When above 0, the combined p-value is set to 1
#'   unless at least \code{ceiling(min_sig_fraction * n_valid)} samples are
#'   individually significant at \code{sig_alpha}. This enforces
#'   reproducibility more strictly than the sign gate but costs power, since
#'   it discards genuine gradients that reach per-sample significance in only
#'   some replicates (e.g. samples with few target cells).
#' @param sig_alpha Numeric. Per-sample significance threshold used for
#'   \code{n_sig_samples} and the optional \code{min_sig_fraction} gate
#'   (default: 0.05).
#'
#' @return A list with components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{fisher_pval}}{Numeric. Fisher's combined p-value
#'     (set to 1.0 if sign consistency is below threshold, or if the
#'     optional \code{min_sig_fraction} gate is not met).}
#'   \item{\code{fisher_stat}}{Numeric. Fisher's test statistic
#'     (-2 * sum(log(p_i))).}
#'   \item{\code{median_coef}}{Numeric. Median coefficient across samples
#'     (equal weighting per replicate).}
#'   \item{\code{sign_consistency}}{Numeric. Fraction of samples agreeing
#'     on direction.}
#'   \item{\code{n_valid}}{Integer. Number of valid samples used.}
#'   \item{\code{n_sig_samples}}{Integer. Number of valid samples
#'     individually significant at \code{sig_alpha} (reproducibility
#'     diagnostic; reported whether or not the gate is enabled).}
#' }
#'
#' @details Fisher's method combines independent p-values:
#'
#'   \code{X^2 = -2 * sum(log(p_i)), df = 2k}
#'
#'   where k is the number of p-values. The sign consistency gate ensures
#'   that the combined result is only significant when replicates agree on
#'   the direction of the effect at the requested threshold. With the default
#'   strict gate, contradictory nonzero signs give \code{fisher_pval = 1}
#'   regardless of individual p-values.
#'
#'   Zero p-values remain valid for the median, sign gate, and replicate counts.
#'   Before Fisher combination, p-values below \code{1e-15} are set to that
#'   floor. Non-finite p-values or coefficients and probabilities outside
#'   \code{[0, 1]} are excluded. The sign fraction is calculated over nonzero
#'   coefficients; exact-zero coefficients do not count as dissenting signs.
#'   The returned p-value is unadjusted; \code{run_ripple()} applies BH within
#'   each target cell type. Combining replicates does not correct violations
#'   of the within-sample model assumptions.
