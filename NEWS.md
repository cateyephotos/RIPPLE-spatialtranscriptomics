# ripple (development version)

* Return complete radius neighborhoods using BiocNeighbors, now a required
  dependency.
* Calculate distances and spatial neighbors within each biological sample.
  Add `calculate_distance_to_type_by_sample()` and `check_coordinate_frames()`.
* Retain zero-valued Wald p-values in replicate aggregation and sign checking.
* Match residual spatial diagnostics to the analysis distance settings.
* Report confounder fits whose distance effects cannot be estimated separately.
* Exclude target cells from the default query-location permutation pool.
  Direct calls require `target_mask_all`; `permutation_pool = "all"` preserves
  the previous behavior. The standalone R/GPU scripts retain the full pool.
* Update synthetic benchmarks with matched-expression recovery and runtime
  results. Count filtered planted genes as missed detections and distinguish
  pooled per-gene FPR from complete-null empirical FDR.

# ripple 0.1.0

Initial release of the RIPPLE package, accompanying the preprint. Version
numbering starts counting from the first public release; all pre-release
development is collected here under 0.1.0.

## Preprint

* Mangana C, Maier BB (2026). RIPPLE: replicate-aware detection of
  cell-type-anchored proximity gradients in spatial transcriptomics.
  *bioRxiv*, doi:
  [10.64898/2026.07.23.740288](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.07.23.740288).
* `inst/CITATION` and `citation("ripple")` now point at the preprint;
  the earlier "preprint in preparation" placeholder is retired.

## Core method

* Per-replicate Poisson GLM with cell-size offset for distance-conditioned
  gene expression (`fit_poisson()`, `fit_poisson_controlled()`).
* Cross-replicate inference via Fisher's combined p-value with sign-consistency
  gating (`compute_fisher_pval()`).
* Reproducibility diagnostic `n_sig_samples` (number of replicates individually
  significant at `sig_alpha`) is reported on every call, so users can see which
  gradients are supported by multiple replicates rather than one strong sample.
* Optional per-sample significance gate `min_sig_fraction` (default `0`, off).
  When set, a gene is only called if at least
  `ceiling(min_sig_fraction * n_samples)` replicates are individually
  significant. Off by default because it trades power for stricter
  reproducibility (it discards genuine gradients that reach per-sample
  significance in only some replicates, especially in small samples).
* `gradient_score` is defined as `median_coef`, the median of the per-sample
  Poisson GLM coefficients (equal weight per replicate).
* Two-tier expression filtering (strict for regular genes, lenient for
  a curated set of priority genes) to rescue sparse but biologically important
  transcripts. The built-in priority list (chemokines, cytokines, interleukins,
  interferons, and receptors) is curated from MGI, NCBI Gene, and Zlotnik &
  Yoshie (2012); a species-matched human list is derived automatically.
* Optional confounder control via bivariate GLM with a second cell type
  (`run_ripple_confounder()`), with classification of genes as
  query-specific / enhanced / niche-driven / underpowered.

## Pipeline

* `run_ripple()` is the main entry point; a single call already combines
  across samples (Fisher) and across cell types, and writes
  `summary/all_genes_results.csv`. `merge_ripple_results()` stitches together
  cell types that were run as separate jobs.
* `run_ripple_atlas()` produces publication-style figures
  (volcano, decay curves, dotplot, heatmap, fGSEA panels, contamination
  flagging).
* `run_ripple_fgsea()` performs reproducible pathway enrichment with a
  user-supplied seed; `run_ripple_lr()` integrates results with
  ligand-receptor databases via NicheNet.
* CPU permutation via `run_permutation_tests()`; GPU permutation script
  shipped under `inst/python/run_permutation_gpu.py`.

## Inputs

* Accepts in-memory or `.rds`-stored `Seurat`, `SingleCellExperiment`, and
  `SpatialExperiment` objects via a unified input adapter.
* `make_ripple_input()` builds a canonical object from raw counts, metadata,
  and coordinates; `read_ripple_csv()` loads from a directory of CSVs.
* All entry points perform input validation with informative error messages
  before any compute begins.
* Configuration is resolved as explicit argument, then `options(ripple.*)`,
  then environment variable, then a built-in default, so SLURM/env-driven
  runs honour the documented options.
* Seurat input auto-selects the raw-counts assay in priority order
  Xenium -> RNA -> Spatial before falling back to the active assay with
  a warning. The earlier default (active assay) silently picked up `SCT`
  after `SCTransform()`. Override with `assay = "..."`.
* Seurat v5 multi-layer assays (e.g. `counts.1`, `counts.2` after
  `merge()`) are joined transparently at load. Users no longer have to
  call `JoinLayers()` manually before `run_ripple()`.
* Xenium FOV centroids in `obj@images$fov[.N]` are extracted into
  `x_centroid` / `y_centroid` automatically when `@meta.data` has no
  coordinate columns, using `Seurat::GetTissueCoordinates()`.
* Non-integer counts (from `SCT`, `LogNormalize`, or similar) trigger
  an immediate warning at input load, not silent misuse of the Poisson
  GLM.

## Gene specificity

* `classify_gene_specificity()` labels genes `specific` (1 cell type),
  `moderate` (2 up to `broad_threshold` - 1), or `broad`
  (>= `broad_threshold`). `broad_threshold` is the single boundary that
  defines the broad class; raising it flags fewer genes.

## Decay curves

* `bin_decay_data()` gains a `sample_ids` argument. When supplied, it returns
  a per-(sample, bin) table with a `sample_id` column instead of pooling cells
  across samples, making the recommended per-sample workflow a one-liner. It
  also gains `min_cells_per_bin` (default `10L`); bins with fewer cells are
  dropped to avoid unstable proportions.
* `plot_gradient_curve()` auto-detects per-sample mode when the input has a
  `sample_id` column, and gains `min_cells_per_bin` (default `10L`) and
  `min_samples_per_bin` (default `2L`) filters. Pooled mode remains available.
  Its docstring flags that pooled mode overstates precision when replicates
  disagree, and recommends per-sample mode for manuscript figures.
* `plot_k_diagnostics()` computes distances within each sample (never pooled
  across samples), so overlapping per-sample coordinate frames cannot produce
  meaningless cross-sample distances.

## Diagnostics and warnings

* Data-quality caveats are raised via `warning()` (not verbose-only messages),
  so they surface in batch/SLURM runs: distance-cap saturation, cell types
  skipped for too few cells/samples/genes, only two valid samples, high
  collinearity in the confounder model, empty results, and running on a
  subset of target cell types (which weakens the cross-cell-type
  contamination check).
* `run_ripple()` and `run_ripple_confounder()` error clearly if the input
  has fewer than 2 unique sample IDs, instead of silently skipping every
  cell type with per-type "need >= 2 samples" warnings.
* A `[HH:MM:SS] Cell type N of M: <name>` message fires at each cell-type
  boundary regardless of `verbose`, so long runs show progress even in
  batch scripts.

## Performance

* Medium synthetic benchmark (5 samples x 300 genes x 2 target types):
  32.5 s -> 14.5 s (~2.2x faster end-to-end). Real-data runs on full imaging
  panels with many target cell types should see proportional gains;
  parallelising across target cell types via the `inst/slurm/` array templates
  remains the largest additional lever.
* Local fan-out over target cell types via `future.apply::future_lapply()`
  is documented in the `parallelization` vignette. No changes to
  `run_ripple()`; users subset the input to `query + one target` per worker
  and `rbindlist()` the results.
* `consolidate_parallel_ripple()` merges the per-worker output trees
  produced by the parallel fan-out into a single canonical results
  directory, so `ripple_plot_qc()` and other directory-based downstream
  functions work without modification. Query cells in
  `qc/cell_distances.csv.gz` are deduped across workers to avoid
  N-fold inflation in the composition and distance panels.

## Data

* `ripple_mock_data`, a synthetic 50-gene x 600-cell x 3-sample dataset with
  a planted distance-dependent gradient in T cells; ships with the package
  for examples, tests, and tutorials.

## Reproducibility

* fGSEA results are deterministic given a user seed (`fgsea_seed`).
* Sign-consistency gating handles zero-coefficient samples consistently.
* Permutation testing compares the observed statistic against a null built
  from the same statistic (the median of per-sample coefficients).

## Documentation

* Comprehensive README covering pipeline stages, statistical model,
  configuration, and troubleshooting.
* Roxygen2 documentation for all exported functions; four vignettes
  (getting started, CosMx NSCLC walkthrough, parallelization, benchmarks).

## Packaging

* Installable as a standalone R package; legacy standalone scripts have
  been removed from the main code path
* Optional dependencies (Bioconductor input classes, fgsea/msigdbr, spdep,
  nichenetr, pheatmap) are guarded at runtime with actionable install
  messages.
